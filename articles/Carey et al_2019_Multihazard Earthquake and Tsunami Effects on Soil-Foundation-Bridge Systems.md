Abstract:  Large earthquakes and tsunamis can damage or lead to the collapse of lifeline bridges, resulting in human and socioeconomic losses as well as prolonged recovery times. Although many simulation models are available for the individual effects of earthquake and tsunami hazards on bridges, there are limited modeling approaches for predicting damage from sequential earthquake and tsunami haz- ards. A bridge modeling approach, which includes soil – foundation – structure interaction effects, is developed within the  ﬁ nite-element framework OpenSees to quantify sequential earthquake and tsunami-induced damage. Multihazard interaction diagrams that relate earth- quake and tsunami intensity measures to bridge system damage show that the residual effects of earthquake loading on the bridge system reduce resistance to subsequent tsunami loading.

# Introduction  

Coastal bridges serve as lifelines following earthquakes and tsuna- mis, and their protection is critical for minimizing loss of life, reducing economic impacts, and expediting post-disaster recovery. The seismic demands for coastal bridges are well investigated, and established codes allow bridge engineers to specify appropriate re- sistance. Resistance to tsunami-induced loading was typically not addressed in the design of bridges; however, research efforts have increased since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, and the most recent ASCE/SEI 7-16 ( ASCE 2016 ) stand- ard has a new chapter on estimating tsunami-induced loads for structural design ( Chock 2016 ). Although the focus of ASCE/SEI 7-16 is buildings, experimental programs focused on bridge response to tsunami loading show the importance of various physi- cal effects, including entrapped air, wave overtopping, and sub- structure  ﬂ exibility ( Hoshikuma et al. 2013 ;  Hayatdavoodi et al. 2014 ;  Istrati et al. 2016 ). Researchers have also performed numeri- cal simulations to estimate tsunami loads for typical bridges along the Paci ﬁ c coast of Oregon and California ( Yim et al. 2015 ; Azadbakht and Yim 2015 ,  2016 ).  

Coastal bridges prone to subduction-zone earthquakes (e.g., in the Paci ﬁ c Northwest, Alaska, Chile, and Japan) face the multi- hazard scenario of a large-magnitude earthquake created at the subducting plate boundary followed by a near- ﬁ eld tsunami. Engineers have not extensively examined bridge response during earthquake-tsunami multihazards because representative physi- cal experiments pose unique challenges. In addition, software capabilities for modeling structural response and tracking dam- age across sequential hazards are limited. The dif ﬁ culties associ- ated with modeling multihazards are further exacerbated when the effects of soil – structure interaction are included (i.e., how the soil response affects the bridge piers, and in turn, how the bridge- pier response affects the superstructure).  

Additional physical experiments are needed to understand bridge response during an earthquake – tsunami multihazard event. A  ﬁ rst step in the experimental design would be to examine bridge response across a wide range of hazard levels using simulation models. For hydrodynamic loading, OpenFOAM is commonly used to simulate the forces imparted on structures ( Hayatdavoodi et al. 2014 ;  Motley et al. 2016 ;  Winter et al. 2018 ); however, OpenFOAM considers the structure to be a rigid object, or it must be used in a staggered frame- work with solid  ﬁ nite-element analysis to account for structural  ﬂ exi- bility and damage ( Madurapperuma and Wijeyewickrema 2012 ). The OpenSees  ﬁ nite-element software framework ( McKenna et al. 2010 ) has been used to simulate bridge response to earthquake motions, including soil – structure interaction effects ( Elgamal et al. 2008 ; Zhang et al. 2008 ;  Jeremi c et al. 2009 ). Although computational  ﬂ uid dynamics modules, which allow users to impart hydrodynamic load- ing on  ﬂ exible structures, have been introduced to the OpenSees framework ( Zhu and Scott 2014 ;  Zhu et al. 2018 ), a common approach to represent hydrodynamic loads is to apply a vertical distri- bution of the lateral load along the height of a structure ( Gidaris et al. 2017 ;  Petrone et al. 2017 ;  Attary et al. 2017a ,  b ;  Alam et al. 2018 ). Beyond simpli ﬁ ed single-degree-of-freedom models ( Scott and Mason 2017 ), few simulation approaches for sequential earthquake and tsunami loading have been developed.  

Given the paucity of models used to predict the damage caused by earthquake – tsunami multihazards, the objective of this paper is to develop and illustrate a suitable modeling framework to predict the sequential effects of these hazards on coastal bridges. The framework uses a two-dimensional (2D) multihazard interaction diagram that incorporates concepts from incremental dynamic  
displacement-based beam – column  ﬁ nite elements, each with con- stant axial deformation and linear curvature approximations along its length, and  ﬁ ber-discretized cross sections at the Gauss integra- tion points. The concrete constitutive model proposed by Karsan and Jirsa ( 1969 ) and Kent and Park ( 1971 ) with modi ﬁ cations by Yassin ( 1994 ) (available as  Concrete02  in OpenSees) and the steel reinforcement constitutive model proposed by Menegotto and Pinto ( 1973 ) with modi ﬁ cations by Filippou et al. ( 1983 ) (available as Steel02  in OpenSees) de ﬁ ne the constitutive response of  ﬁ bers in the column cross section. Transverse spiral reinforcement leads to a concrete con ﬁ nement strength ratio of  $K\!=\!1.38$   for the column core ( Karthik and Mander 2011 ), where the nominal concrete compres- sive strength is  $f_{c}^{\prime}\,{=}\,28\,\mathrm{MPa}$  

analysis (IDA) ( Vamvatsikos and Cornell 2002 ). Earthquake and tsunami intensities are incremented, then  ﬁ nite-element analyses determine the failure points on the interaction diagram. The failure of a coastal bridge is de ﬁ ned as occurring when an individual hazard or the combination of the two hazards causes an engineering demand parameter (EDP) to exceed a limit state.  

Details of how the earthquake and tsunami hazards are applied to a coastal bridge require some knowledge of the simulated bridge and numerical modeling framework. First, a prototypical coastal bridge modeled in the OpenSees  ﬁ nite-element framework, includ- ing the effects of soil – structure interaction, is presented. Then, as an illustration, the modeling methodology is applied to this prototypi- cal bridge. In this methodology, earthquake motions selected from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake recordings are input using a direct soil – structure interaction approach. Bridge damage is tracked throughout the soil – foundation – bridge system, and the damaged state and residual displacements induced by the earthquake are retained as the initial model state prior to the application of tsunami-induced hydrodynamic forces, applied as a uniformly dis- tributed lateral load. The interaction diagrams quantify the extent to which ground shaking reduces the bridge resistance to lateral loads imparted by subsequent tsunami  ﬂ ow.  

The bridge superstructure was modeled after a prestressed, post- tensioned RC bridge deck described by Shamsabadi et al. ( 2007 ). The superstructure mass was lumped at the center of gravity of the deck cross section, and the corresponding gravity load on the col- umn was   $3{,}460\,\mathrm{kN}{.}$  , approximately   $13\%$   of the gross section capacity. The moment – curvature response of the column cross sec- tion for the assumed gravity load on the column is presented in Fig.  2 .

# Prototypical Coastal Bridge  

A Caltrans Type I bridge design was chosen to demonstrate the modeling framework for the sequential effects of earthquake and tsunami hazards on bridges. In previous work, bridges of similar design have been analyzed using 2D nonlinear  ﬁ nite-element mod- els ( Shamsabadi et al. 2007 ;  Zhang et al. 2008 ;  Chiaramonte et al. 2013 ;  Khosravifar 2012 ;  Barbosa et al. 2014 ;  Carey et al. 2014 ). Additional details on the bridge design used herein can be found in Barbosa et al. ( 2014 ), Carey et al. ( 2014 ), and Carey ( 2014 ).  

The  ﬁ nite-element model used in this study focuses on the trans- verse direction and was developed based on the geometry presented in Fig.  1 . The above-grade height of the bridge column was   $6.1\,\mathrm{m}$  , and the pile foundation extends  $20\,\mathrm{m}$   from the ground surface to the bedrock. As per a Caltrans Type I shaft, the  $1.1\mathrm{-m}$   diameter circular cross section of the pile foundation and bridge column is maintained along the full height. The column and shaft had   $18\,\#32\,\mathrm{M}$   Grade 420 longitudinal reinforcing steel bars. To simulate nonlinear material response, the bridge column was discretized into six

Fig. 1.  Views of soil – foundation – bridge model considered for analysis: (a) longitudinal; and (b) transverse.  
The soil continuum was modeled as a 20-m-high, 1-m-wide, 2D, plane-strain column whose constitutive response was characterized by a pressure-dependent-multiyield (PDMY) model ( Elgamal et al. 2002 ;  Yang et al. 2003 ) for very dense sand (relative density of  $90\%$  ). The purpose of the soil column was to model the local site response and include how a typical earthquake motion would be modi ﬁ ed (i.e., amplitude, frequency content, and duration) as it travels from the bedrock to the ground surface in a dense sand con- tinuum. The choice of a dense sand pro ﬁ le simpli ﬁ es the soil response and minimizes the possibility of ground failure during earthquake loading due to liquefaction and cyclic mobility, which are beyond the scope of this work. The constitutive parameters that characterize the sand response were selected from Yang et al. ( 2003 ) with additional details from Carey ( 2014 ). The soil column mesh was composed of  $1\times1\,\mathrm{m}$   nine-node    $_{u-p}$   quadrilateral ele- ments, which couple pore water pressure and soil skeleton displace- ment. The model used a shear beam assumption in which the lateral displacement of the soil column is constant at a speci ﬁ ed depth. Based on work by Chiaramonte et al. ( 2013 ), a  ${300}\mathrm{.m}$   out-of-plane thickness for the soil column ensures that the response of the struc- ture does not affect the soil response.  

At the soil – pile interface, nonlinear one-dimensional (1D)  $p{-}y$  ,  $\scriptstyle{t-z_{i}}$  , and  $q–z$   springs were used to simulate lateral resistance, skin friction, and end-bearing behavior, respectively. The stiffness coef- ﬁ cients of the soil springs are a function of the ultimate capacity of the soil ( Reese et al. 1974 ). The  $p{-}y$   spring coef ﬁ cients are based on API ( 1993 ) recommendations for clean, cohesionless sands, and were further modi ﬁ ed to account for large overburden effective stresses ( Boulanger et al. 1999 ). To align with the soil interface springs and the soil column mesh, the pile foundation was discre- tized into 20 displacement-based beam  ﬁ nite elements, each of   $1\,\mathrm{m}$  length and with the same  ﬁ ber-discretized cross section as the col- umn. For transient  ﬁ nite-element analysis of the model, a damping ratio of   $5\%$   characterized the mass and stiffness proportional com- ponents of Rayleigh damping ( Hall 2006 ;  Charney 2008 ). Damping was applied over a natural frequency range of 0.58 to   $125\,\mathrm{Hz}$  , the range between the natural frequency and the third mode of the soil – bridge system, which follows the assumption made by Chiaramonte et al. ( 2013 ).  

# Earthquake Loading  

The east-west (EW) components for 23 subduction-zone earth- quake motions were selected from the KiK-net and K-NET stations, located on bedrock, that recorded the 201  $1\ M_{W}=9.0$   Great East Japan Earthquake. The earthquake motions were processed using fourth-order Butterworth bandpass  ﬁ lters with low-pass corner fre- quencies of  $25\,\mathrm{Hz}$   and motion-speci ﬁ c high-pass corner frequencies between 0.15 and   $0.18\,\mathrm{Hz}$  . The recording stations for the ground motions are provided in Table  1 , along with the  ﬁ ltered and baseline-corrected intensity measures of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and signi ﬁ cant duration   $(D_{5-95})$  ). Although these measures of earthquake motion intensity were not used for record selection in this work, the measures show the wide range of motion characteris- tics input to the soil – foundation – bridge model. To highlight the characteristics of long-duration ground motions, the EW compo- nent of ground motion recorded at the FKSH14 station and its elas- tic response spectrum (  $5\%$   damping ratio) are shown in Fig.  3 .  

In addition, Table  1  lists the spectral acceleration,  $S_{a}$  , assuming  $5\%$   damping, at the fundamental period of the soil – foundation – bridge model. The fundamental period was found to be    $T_{1}=1.71$   s from an eigenvalue analysis. The calculated value of  $T_{1}$   is long for a ﬁ xed-based bridge; however, the addition of the pile and surround- ing soil decreased the overall system stiffness and elongated the natural period of the soil – foundation – bridge system, and the long period does not detract from the methodology presented herein.  

# Tsunami Loading  

Tsunami forces on structures are classi ﬁ ed as (1) hydrodynamic forces, (2) hydrostatic and buoyant forces, (3) impulsive surge forces, (4) debris impact forces, and (5) debris damming forces ( Yeh 2009 ;  FEMA 2012 ;  Yeh et al. 2015 ). The focus herein is on horizontal hydrodynamic forces during steady- ﬂ ow conditions (i.e., the load applied to the bridge during tsunami inundation). Other hydrodynamic forces, such as uplift and slamming forces, and the effect of large debris ( Ko et al. 2015 ), have a great impact on struc- tures but are not considered herein. The magnitude of the horizontal hydrodynamic force,  $F_{D},$  , is given as ( FEMA 2012 )  

$$
F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}\leftC_{D}\rho B\big(h u^{2}\big)_{\mathrm{max}}\right.
$$  

where    $C_{D}=$   drag coef ﬁ cient of the enveloped object;  $\rho=$   ﬂ uid density;  $B\!=$  out-of-plane breadth of the object; and   $(h u^{2})_{\mathrm{max}}$   is the maximum momentum  ﬂ ux per unit mass, where    $h$   is the  ﬂ ow height, and  $u$   is the  ﬂ ow velocity, whose maxima do not necessar- ily co-occur.  

Several approaches are available to apply hydrodynamic loads to a  ﬁ nite-element model of a soil – foundation – bridge system. The approach taken herein is to apply equivalent mechanical loads to the system based on a study by Arnason et al. ( 2009 ) that describes reduced-scale physical modeling testing of tsunami loading on cir- cular bridge piers. Two observations from Arnason et al. ( 2009 ) are

prescient for the current study. First, the loading on a bridge column from a tsunami is primarily due to the hydrodynamic load calcu- lated by Eq. ( 1 ). Second, the load computed by this equation gener- ally overestimates the hydrodynamic force compared with experi- mental results. Based on the conservatism inherent in these observations, tsunami loading of the soil – foundation – bridge model was applied as a drag force    $F_{D}$   computed by Eq. ( 1 ) for the given values of  ﬂ uid density,  $\rho=1{,}000\,\mathrm{kg}\mathrm{\bar{m}}^{3}$  ; the bridge column diame- ter,  $B=1.1\,\mathrm{m}$  ; and the drag coef ﬁ cient,  $C_{D}=1.1$  . For  ﬂ ow heights that reach the superstructure, the tributary deck width,  $B=31.7\,\mathrm{m}$  , and drag coef ﬁ cient,    $C_{D}=2$  , were used for the portion of the  ﬂ ow that contacts the bridge deck, as shown in Fig.  4 .  

# Analysis Framework  

The multihazard analysis sequence was split into three stages. In the ﬁ rst stage, the earthquake motion was applied to the soil – bridge model at the soil – bedrock interface as an equivalent force – time his- tory, in series with a viscous dashpot that absorbs the re ﬂ ected wave energy typically dissipated by the elastic half-space ( Zhang et al. 2008 ;  Chiaramonte et al. 2013 ). The lateral degree of freedom at the soil – bedrock interface was unconstrained; therefore, the soil – bridge system had roller  ﬁ xity, as indicated in Fig.  4(a) . During the second stage, the soil – foundation – bridge model was prepared for hydrody- namic loading, with its damaged state from the earthquake [Fig.  4 (b) ] as the initial condition. The dashpot representing the compliant bedrock boundary was removed, and the soil column was con- strained with pin connections, preventing rigid-body movement that would occur with the boundary conditions of the  ﬁ rst stage. To eliminate structural vibrations, a near critically damped transient analysis was performed by increasing the mass and stiffness propor- tional contributions to Rayleigh damping. This critical damping analysis takes only a few seconds of simulation time; however, the time between the end of strong shaking and near- ﬁ eld tsunami  
inundation can be on the order of minutes to hours depending on the fault rupture details and the bridge proximity to the coastline. For a bridge on the Oregon coast, this time is estimated to be between 15 and 40 minutes for a Cascadia Subduction Zone event. The dynamic response – time history for the  ﬁ rst and second phase was computed numerically via the TRBDF2 integrator ( Bathe 2007 ) implemented in OpenSees.  

After checking equilibrium of the damaged structure, the increased damping force contributions were removed prior to start- ing the hydrodynamic pushover analysis in the third stage. The hydrodynamic force was applied as a uniformly distributed load on the bridge column over an assumed  ﬂ ow height, as presented in Fig.  4(c) . The intensity of the distributed load was increased to rep- resent increasing  ﬂ ow velocity in the hydrodynamic pushover. A displacement-controlled integrator ( Clarke and Hancock 1990 ) was used to increase the loading for this nonlinear static pushover analy- sis in OpenSees.  

# Modeling Methodology and Sequence  

The proposed multihazard interaction diagrams consist of a ground motion intensity parameter and tsunami intensity parameter on the ordinate and abscissa axis, respectively. The failure of the soil – bridge system is de ﬁ ned as occurring when a system response parameter exceeds a damage-threshold value, or limit state, due to either one or both of the hazards. Ribeiro et al. ( 2014 ) proposed interaction diagrams to examine the damage from sequential main- shock and aftershock earthquake hazards, and an analogous approach was taken herein. Intensity measures considered in pre- dicting the prescribed limit-state thresholds are the  $5\%$   damped lin- ear spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the bridge [e. g.,    $S_{a}(T_{1})]$  ð Þ ] and the total hydrodynamic force,  $F_{D}$  , imparted by the tsunami. The foregoing intensity measures focus the methodology; however, alternative intensity measures can be easily incorporated in the modeling framework. The maximum drift ratio,  $\Delta_{\mathrm{peak}}$  , of the bridge deck relative to the pile displacement at the ground surface was used to de ﬁ ne limit states (e.g., serviceability and ultimate) for the model.  

The following steps are used to generate interaction diagrams for the sequential earthquake – tsunami multihazards:  

1. An earthquake motion is selected from the suite of motions, and an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) ( Vamvatsikos and Cornell 2002 ) is performed using the earthquake motion. Linear scaling factors are incremented to increase the ampli- tude of the earthquake motion until the model reaches a pre- scribed limit state,    $\Delta_{\mathrm{peak}}$  . Once the limit state scaling factor is determined, a range of linear scaling factors is generated from zero to the peak value in increments of 0.025. The scale factors lead to the abscissa coordinates of earthquake motion intensity on the interaction diagrams. Note that for an earthquake motion scaling factor of zero, the limit state is reached with tsunami loading via hydrodynamic pushover, as described in the next step.  

2. A  ﬁ xed tsunami  ﬂ ow height,    $h$  , and an initial  ﬂ ow velocity,    $u$  , are chosen, and the corresponding drag force,  $F_{D}.$  , is calculated using Eq. ( 1 ). After damping the structural response, the drag force is applied to the bridge column as a uniform distributed load from the ground surface to the speci ﬁ ed tsunami height,  $h$  . When the  ﬂ ow height exceeds the height of the bridge column, a second drag force is applied to the bridge deck. The out-of- plane breadth of the bridge deck is speci ﬁ ed as the tributary width of the bridge span supported by the column, which assumes that the abutments are also responsible for resisting part of the load. The  ﬂ ow velocity is incrementally increased until the drift limit state is reached in a hydrodynamic pushover analysis.  

3. The tsunami loading is incremented to the next inundation height, and the hydrodynamic pushover analysis is repeated with the initial state of the bridge being the  ﬁ nal damaged state following earthquake loading. For each earthquake motion scaling factor, independent analyses are performed for each ﬂ ow height. Considering low-intensity ground shaking with high-intensity tsunami loading accounts for the occurrence of distant earthquakes that could lead to large tsunami events. For instance, a Cascadia Subduction Zone event in the Paci ﬁ c Ocean off the coast of Oregon would produce little to no ground shaking in Hawaii but could generate a large tsunami.  

The preceding steps are repeated for each earthquake motion to develop interaction diagrams that cover the combinations of seis- mic and tsunami hazards that lead to the failure of the bridge system.  

Two example response – time histories of the deck drift using these analysis steps are shown in Fig.  5 . The time history presented in Fig.  5(a)  is for a case where a limit state of  $5\%$   peak drift was reached during the scaled earthquake motion. Although the bridge deck can reach larger drifts during the tsunami loading phase, the case shown in Fig.  5(a)  is considered an  earthquake controlled  case because the ground motion intensity is suf ﬁ cient for the bridge to reach the prescribed limit state. The second case, presented in Fig.  5(b) , is for a  tsunami controlled  case where the  $5\%$   limit state was not reached during the scaled earthquake motion, but instead, the damage was accumulated over the two phases of the multihazard analysis, and the deck drift reached the limit state during hydrodynamic loading. Note that the case presented in Fig.  5(b)  could exhibit an earthquake controlled response by pre- scribing a limit state with lower peak drift (e.g.,  $3\%$  ).  

# Results and Discussion  

Earthquake – tsunami interaction diagrams created using the fore- going analysis procedure are shown in Fig.  6  for four tsunami  ﬂ ow heights and a single earthquake motion, the FKSH14 recording, which is summarized in Fig.  3 . Each interaction diagram shows the relationship between spectral acceleration produced by the scaled ground motion at the fundamental period of the bridge system and the ensuing hydrodynamic force at which the system reached the prescribed limit state. Note that the bridge system limit state becomes earthquake controlled as the ground motion scaling increases, leading to the sharp drop in the interaction diagrams where no hydrodynamic force is required to reach the drift thresh- old. The IDA scale factors where the bridge model became earth- quake controlled for each drift limit state for the 23 earthquake motions are shown in Table  1 .  

The intercept of the vertical axis on each interaction diagram shows the hydrodynamic force required to reach the prescribed limit state without the preceding ground motion (i.e., due to hydrody- namic pushover analysis of an undamaged bridge model). Based on the  ﬂ exural response of the column and pile elements during the hydrodynamic pushover analyses, plasticity developed below the ground surface over a length of two times the column diameter, which is common for a Caltrans Type I design. The shifting plastic hinge location leads to a lower hydrodynamic force required to reach each limit state than that predicted from the sectional analysis of Fig.  2  for a  ﬁ xed-base assumption. This also emphasizes the effect of soil – structure interaction on the model response.

Interaction diagrams of hydrodynamic force and  ﬂ ow velocity for the FKSH14 EW ground motion and  ﬂ ow heights: (a)  $3.5\:\mathrm{m}$  , below bridge deck; (b)  $6.1\,\mathrm{m}$  , at the bottom of the bridge deck; (c)  $6.3\,\mathrm{m}$  , on the bridge deck; and (d)  $6.9\,\mathrm{m}$  , on the bridge deck.  

In addition to hydrodynamic forces, the  ﬂ ow velocities at which the limit states are reached for the four  ﬂ ow heights are provided in Fig.  6 . For the  ﬂ ow heights at or below the bridge deck (  $h=3.5$   and  $6.1\,\mathrm{m})$  ), the associated  ﬂ ow velocities are between 10 and   $15\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s},$  , which is unlikely to occur. The  ﬂ ow velocities required to reach the limit state when the  ﬂ ow was at the height of the bridge deck (  $\mathit{(h}=$  6.3 and  $6.9\,\mathrm{m}$  ) were in the range of 3 to  $7\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$  , which is more in line with estimates from recent tsunamis ( Fritz et al. 2012 ;  Yeh et al. 2013 ) and ﬂ ow speeds used in wave ﬂ ume experiments ( Hoshikuma et al. 2013 ). For  ﬂ ow heights on the bridge deck, there is little variability in the  ﬂ ow height required to reach the limit state even though the associated hydrodynamic force exhibit more vari- ability. The preceding observation is due to the dependence of  $F_{D}$  on velocity squared according to Eq. ( 1 ) and the large tributary width of the bridge deck relative to the column diameter.  

Interaction diagrams for the 23 ground motions listed in Table  1 are shown in Fig.  7 . As expected, there is signi ﬁ cant variability in the spectral acceleration at which the bridge system transitioned to

earthquake controlled response due to the effects of record-to-re- cord variability on the drift of the bridge system. Consistent with incremental dynamic analysis ( Vamvatsikos and Cornell 2002 ), snapback of the earthquake response led to increased variability of the hydrodynamic force required to reach the limit states, particu- larly for the  $5\%$   and  $7\%$   drift limits.  

Statistical measures of the median and 10th and 90th percentiles encapsulate the variability over the 23 ground motions selected for each  ﬂ ow height and limit state in the  ﬁ rst three rows of Fig.  7 . The ﬁ nal row of Fig.  7  shows the mean interaction diagrams where the hydrodynamic force required to reach each drift limit state was averaged over the 23 earthquake motions. Both the median and mean interaction diagrams were computed over spectral accelera- tion intervals, or bins, of   $0.02\,\mathrm{g}$  . Lower earthquake intensities (  $S_{a}\le$   $0.5\,\mathrm{g}$   for this bridge) have little impact on the tsunami intensity that leads to exceeding the drift limit states. Additionally, for increasing earthquake intensities, the tsunami intensities that lead to exceeding the drift limit states are reduced because earthquake damage reduces the capacity of the bridge model to sustain additional dam- age from a subsequent tsunami. The mean interaction diagrams show that the lateral resistance of this bridge is reduced by approxi- mately   $50\%$   or more for spectral accelerations exceeding   $0.3\,\mathrm{g}$   for all  ﬂ ow heights considered.  

# Conclusions  

A methodology for developing earthquake and tsunami hazard interaction diagrams was developed and applied to an example soil – foundation – bridge model. Although the bridge model presented in this article is a speci ﬁ c case, the analysis methodology provides insight into the response of coastal bridges to sequential long- duration earthquake motions and tsunami loading. For cases where the bridge model did not exceed prede ﬁ ned drift limit states under ground excitation, subsequent tsunami  ﬂ ows that reach the super- structure can cause severe damage. Considering only hydrodynamic forces,  ﬂ ow heights that do not reach the superstructure require a large, and highly unlikely,  ﬂ ow velocity in order to achieve the drift limit states. However, as the tsunami inundation reaches the deck, considerably lower  ﬂ ow velocities are required for exceedance of the drift limit states. In these cases, other effects, such as scour ( Tonkin et al. 2003 ) and soil instability ( Yeh and Mason 2014 ), must be considered for the substructure, not only during inundation but also for tsunami drawdown. It is worth noting that the ground motions were applied only in the transverse direction for the analysis example, even though potential damage of the bearings at the abut- ment would also in ﬂ uence the impact of the tsunami loading on the structure. Notwithstanding these  ﬁ ndings, the framework is general and can be adapted to other physical phenomena and alternative limit states, such as residual drift.  
Computational  ﬂ uid dynamics (CFD) offers further re ﬁ nements for simulating bridge response to tsunami loading, particularly for axial forces induced in the bridge column due to buoyant forces and wave overtopping of the bridge deck. Although these re ﬁ nements can be accomplished via a staggered approach where pressure – time histories from a CFD simulation are input as force time histories to the soil – foundation – bridge model, this approach omits important ﬂ uid – structure interaction effects owing to the mass and stiffness of the soil – foundation – bridge system. Important three-dimensional effects of debris impact and increased hydrodynamic forces due to damming are also subjects of future investigation.
